## What is the Maze Activity?

Maze is a Sugar activity, aimed at children of any age to learn by playing. The goal of the game is for the player's character to reach the finish.

There are an infinite levels of difficulties which the player can choose from.

One can choose to enable holes in the maze, to make it more challenging. The maze can be a multiplayer by enabling sharing.

## How it works

You have to control the character to reach the finish by dragging your mouse or by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard.

When the collaboration mode is enabled, students can play together as a multiplayer:

You can see more information about the activity [here](https://github.com/godiard/help-activity/blob/master/source/maze.rst).

## Benefits to learning

Solving the Maze activity could improve one's problem solving skills, the player will eventually learn not to walk to a dead end to save time, to beat their classmates on the leaderboard.

Solving mazes can improves one's memory. For example, by remembering which parts of the maze leads to a dead end.

The controls require a hand-eye coordination, the player has to connect the control and the current situation of the game. Children who were not used to holding the mouse or pressing the keyboard will eventually get a hang of it.

## What I like about Maze

You must be wondering, why did I choose the Maze Activity to be reviewed? I could have choosen another activity.

The Maze Activity is the activity I like the most (so far), because it has a simple concept and is addictive. It also has an unlimited levels of difficulties.
My favorite part was when enabling the multiplayer mode and racing to the finish, I'm really looking forward to playing it with my siblings.

## Suggestions and Improvements

It would be great if there is a setting to enable a mode, when enabled reverses all the controls. (e.g. right becomes left, up becomes down, and vice versa.)
This could increase the difficulty and things would be more challenging for those who wants harder levels.
The Maze level itself can have their own specialities. We could make every x-th level a negative color, for example.
There could be some eye-catching graphics, such as an animated character, and different maze tiles.
